Description: An R graphical user interface for processing eddy covariance raw data and release high quality fluxes of the main GHGs exchanged by ecosystems and agricultural fields. Fluxes are estimated through a call to the open source EddyPro software (registered trademark, LI-COR, Biosciences, 2020). 'RFlux' provides tools for the metadata management as well as for the implementation of the robust data cleaning procedure described by Vitale et al (2020) <doi:10.5194/bg-17-1367-2020>.
